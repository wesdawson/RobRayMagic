// This is where you would use $http or $resource to do your API calls to the Node backend from your Angular frontend.
angular.module('ContactService', []).factory('Contact', ['$http', function($http) {

// Those are just placeholders and they wonâ€™t work unless you define those specific routes in your app/routes.js file.
// These services will call our Node backend, retrieve data in JSON format, and then we can use it in our Angular controllers.
